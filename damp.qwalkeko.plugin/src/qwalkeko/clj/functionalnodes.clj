;;;; This file converts Java Changes provided by ChangeNodes into a more structured representation.
;;;; This representation structures changes as a tree (even though it's called a graph everywhere)
;;;;  in which dependent changes are connected.
;;;; A dependency between changes can exist because 
;;;;  - a change is a child of another change (eg: Insert method and Insert expression in body of that method)
;;;;  - two changes modify the same ChildListProperty (eg: insert two expressions in a body at certain index i and j)
;;;; The latter changes can be applied independently from eachother, but indexes of 'later' changes must be changed
;;;;  if earlier changes have not been applied yet.

;;;; The algorithm works in different steps. First of all dependencies of the first kind are detected.
;;;; Second we link together changes that apply on the same list.
;;;; Finally we link together the head of that list with the corresponding change

;;;; The implementation is completely functional, and every operation returns a new graph object.
;;;; Changes are represented internally as numbers (accessed via :graph-idx). This also means that
;;;; indexes should always be converted to a concrete change against the current graph as old concrete changes
;;;; may no longer be correct. Indexes remain unique throughout the lifetime of the graph.

;;;; Most changes have a :original, :copy, :left-parent and :right-parent

  ;First, it is possible to have cycles by having an insert that overwrites a move
  ;while that move moves the node back into the insert. We can fix it by replacing that move with an insert.
  ;Second, a 'swap' may occur, in which move A overwrites the source of move B, and move B needs to go to move A.
  ;This may also happen in larger groups, in which A moves to B, B moves to C, and C moves to A.
  ;We can solve this by ordering these moves and replacing 1 of them by an Insert
